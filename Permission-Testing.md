## Auditing Validation

### Events Logged
- **Event ID 4625**: Failed interactive logon attempt due to invalid credentials.
- **Event ID 4624**: Successful interactive logon using an administrative account.

Both events were recorded in the Windows Security log after enabling logon auditing for success and failure.

### Incident Response Relevance
Logon auditing provides visibility into authentication activity, allowing detection of unauthorized access attempts and confirmation of legitimate logons. Recording both failed and successful events supports investigation, accountability, and timeline reconstruction during security incidents.
