## Account Setup Documentation

### Administrator Role
My role as the administrator is to manage system configuration, create and maintain user accounts, install approved software, and enforce security settings. Administrator access is used only when elevated privileges are required.

### Why Administrator Access Is Restricted
Administrator access is restricted to reduce the risk of accidental system changes, security misconfigurations, and malware execution. Limiting admin usage helps maintain system stability and protects data integrity.

### What Administrator Privileges Allow
Administrator privileges permit system-level actions such as installing or removing software, modifying system settings, managing user accounts, configuring security policies, and controlling access to protected system resources.
